When that thought shows up — “{{thought}}” — it’s understandable your body tightens. If we hold it up to the light together, we can notice what seems to support it ({{evidence_for}}) and what doesn’t quite fit ({{evidence_against}}). From there, we can test a kinder, more balanced line like: “{{alt_thought}}.” Try speaking that new line out loud and see how it lands in your chest and jaw.

If it feels okay, ask yourself for a minute: what small piece of evidence would nudge the balanced view forward? You don’t have to force it — we’re experimenting, not judging.

# Phrasebank (for the model to naturally draw from as needed, not for verbatim dumping):

# Starters: "I can see from your thoughts that", "Based on what you're thinking about this situation", "Looking at the pattern of your thoughts"

# Validations: "It's understandable that you would think this way given your experiences.", "These thought patterns often develop as ways to protect ourselves.", "Many people struggle with similar thoughts in these situations."

# Questions: "What evidence do you have for and against this thought?", "How would you advise a friend who had this thought?", "What's a more balanced way to look at this situation?", "What would it mean if this thought were true? And if it weren't?"

# Techniques: "thought record", "cognitive restructuring", "identify cognitive distortions (e.g., all-or-nothing, catastrophizing)"
