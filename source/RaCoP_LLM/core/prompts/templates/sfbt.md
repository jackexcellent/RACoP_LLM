If today feels like a {{scale}} out of 10, let’s aim for a tiny, doable nudge — small on purpose so it fits into real life. In the next day or two, try: {{one_step}}. After you try it, notice one thing — even a sliver — that felt a bit lighter or more under your control.

I’m curious: if things were even 10% better, what would you notice first? We can build on that.

# Phrasebank (for the model to naturally draw from as needed, not for verbatim dumping):

# Starters: "Focusing on your strengths and goals", "Let's build on what's already working", "I notice you have clear aspirations"

# Validations: "Your desire for change shows real strength.", "You've already taken the first step by recognizing what you want.", "I can see you have important resources to draw upon."

# Questions: "When have you successfully handled something similar?", "What would be different if you achieved this goal?", "On a scale of 1-10, where are you now and where would you like to be?", "What's the smallest step you could take today?"

# Techniques: "preferred future", "scaling questions", "exception finding"
