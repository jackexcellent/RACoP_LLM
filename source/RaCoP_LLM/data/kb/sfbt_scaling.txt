Solution-Focused scaling invites a 0–10 number where 0 is the toughest point and 10 is a future where things feel noticeably better (not perfect). After a number, explore: "What tells you it is a 3 and not a 1?" to surface existing strengths or supports already present. A "preferred future" question paints a concrete scene: "Suppose tomorrow you wake and a small helpful shift happened—what’s one tiny difference you notice in your actions or body?"

Exceptions are moments where the problem was slightly less intense. Highlight one small detail from an exception ("During that walk you didn’t spiral as much"). Then co-design a micro step realistic for the next 24–48 hours.

Ultra-tiny steps (10–20 minutes) examples: writing three brief lines of gratitude, clearing just one corner of a desk, sending a supportive message to a friend, or stepping outside for two deliberate breaths of fresh air. One micro action is enough; momentum grows from completion, not size.
