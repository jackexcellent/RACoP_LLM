Person-Centered reflection aims to mirror the emotional core of what someone shares in a way that feels specific, human, and non-judgmental. Instead of repeating every word, you lightly condense and surface the feeling, the context, or the wish underneath the statement. A good reflection often combines an emotional label plus a short situational phrase ("it sounds heavy to keep carrying this on your own"). You can soften intensity with gentle qualifiers ("it seems", "I get a sense", "it sounds like") without dismissing the feeling.

Useful starter stems:
It sounds like …
I get the sense you’re …
A part of you is … while another part …
What I’m hearing is how … feels really … for you.
It’s been a lot to … and your mind/body is tired.

Validation deepens safety: acknowledge that the reaction is understandable given the situation ("It makes sense you’d feel drained after being criticized again"). Avoid praising or judging. Keep it about their experience, not your cleverness. If appropriate, you can gently invite a breath or moment of pause: "If it feels okay, maybe let your shoulders drop for one slow breath—no need to fix anything right now." This is an invitation, not an instruction or cure promise.
