Cognitive reframing looks at an automatic thought and gently tests how absolute or biased it might be. We collect a little evidence that seems to support it and some that does not fit cleanly. The goal is not forced positivity; it is a more workable, compassionate alternative thought that still respects the hard parts.

Common everyday thinking traps (plain-language): all-or-nothing ("If I’m not perfect, I failed"), catastrophizing ("This one setback ruins everything"), mind reading ("They must think I’m useless"), overgeneralizing ("I always mess up"), labeling ("I’m broken"), discounting positives ("That win doesn’t count"), emotional reasoning ("I feel scared so it must be dangerous"). Naming a pattern can reduce its grip.

Mini example:
Situation: Sent a message; no reply.
Automatic thought: "They hate me; I ruined it."
Emotion: anxious, rejected.
Evidence for: No reply after hours.
Evidence against: They have replied warmly before; they might be busy; no negative message.
Alternative thought: "I feel anxious waiting, but silence doesn’t prove rejection. I can choose a small grounding action while I wait." This preserves the feeling yet loosens the catastrophic conclusion.
